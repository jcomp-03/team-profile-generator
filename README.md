  # team-profile-generator
  ## Project Description
  This application exhibits some pillar concepts associated with object-oriented programming (OOP). Classes are developed as the blueprints for creating objects. Child classes which extend from a parent class are used for the purpose of inheriting the parent class's properties and methods. Instances of objects are created by invoking, or calling, the constructor function of a particular class. Unit testing is also incorporated in this app and is achieved with Jest; tests were written to fail initially, then the minimum code is written so the the tests passes; finally the code is refactored (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR). With respect to the process or functionality of the app, the user is prompted via the command line to enter certain data about a team's manager. The user is subsequently prompted if they would like to add additional members to the team, or finish with inputting. At the culmination of iputting information about their team, several templates for HTML markup are interpolated with the stored user input (i.e. the team's information), returning a dynamic block of HTML which is saved to a file. The HTML will reflect the size of the team. 
  - Build an entire application using object-oriented programming (OOP), separating data and functionality into different constructor functions.
  - Use modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes.
  - Verify that your code works as intended through automated tests using the Jest framework.
  - Take user input and use template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line

  ## Installation
  Once the repository is cloned, from the root directory of where they installed the application the user is to run the command 'npm install' to install required dependencies. After dependencies are loaded, all the user must do to run the application is type 'node index.js' in the command line and answer the prompts as they appear.
  ## Usage
  See the video below for how to use the app.<br>
